Generic single-database configuration.

With the above application you can create a migration repository
with the following command:

$ flask db init

This will add a migrations folder to your application. The contents
of this folder need to be added to version control along with your
other source files.

You can then generate an initial migration:

$ flask db migrate

The migration script needs to be reviewed and edited, as Alembic
currently does not detect every change you make to your models.
In particular, Alembic is currently unable to detect indexes.
Once finalized, the migration script also needs to be added to
version control.

Then you can apply the migration to the database:

$ flask db upgrade
